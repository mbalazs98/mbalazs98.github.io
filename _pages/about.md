I'm a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Sussex, with my main interest lying in biology inspired computing. My research so far has been focused particulary on structural plasticity, synaptic delays and the geometry of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

I'm also a volunteer at The Alan Turing Insitute looking into security risks in SNNs.
